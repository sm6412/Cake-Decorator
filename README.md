# Cake-Decorator
Cake decorator was the first game I created in Unity. Players are responsible for decorating cakes on the conveyor belt according to an order. If the cake reaches the end of the conveyor belt and is not properly decorated, the player loses. A timer keeps track of how long the player lasts in the game. Difficulty is gradually increased every time a cake is correctly decorated.
